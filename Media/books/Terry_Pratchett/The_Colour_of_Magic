This is the first novel in the discworld series.

The main character is an incompetent wizard named Rincewind. He invountarily becomes a guide to a rich tourist with some magic luggage that has a personality of its own! 

The comedy duo (and Rincewind) begin a journey across the disc, hilariry ensues. 

They nearly fall off the Disc (Discworld does not follow convention, it isn't a globe, but rather a Disc supported by four elephants, standing on the back of a Giant turtle) towards the end of the novel, but are rescued and taken to Krull, a city perched on the edge of the Discworld and inhabited by hydrophic wizards. 

The Krullians want to find the sex (not gender!) of the Giant Turtle, so they've built a Space Capsule which -  much like our Mars mission -is a oneway trip into the Abyss. 

They of course, find themselves aboard...
